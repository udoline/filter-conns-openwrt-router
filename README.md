# Filter the realtime network connections via web interface Openwrt-luci 
The motivation is not to filter on the Openwrt (brick) router in the web browser client, because the resources should not be used for this.  
This a [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) custom user script that runs in your web browser client chrome or firefox as an extension or add-on that takes over the filtering of the resulting send network traffic via web interface Openwrt-luci.

## How todo this

Get the Tampermonkey extension for the supported browsers:
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo/)
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
