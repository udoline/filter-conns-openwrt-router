# filter-conns-openwrt-router
The motivation is not to filter on the Openwrt (brick) router in the web browser client, because the resources should not be used for this.  This a Tampermonkey custom user script that runs in your web browser client chrome or firefox as an extension or add-on that takes over the filtering of the resulting send network traffic via web interface  Openwrt-luci.
