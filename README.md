# Filter the realtime network connections via web interface Openwrt-luci 
The motivation is not to filter on the Openwrt (brick) router in the web browser client, because the resources should not be used for this.  
This a Tampermonkey custom user script that runs in your web browser client chrome or firefox as an extension or add-on that takes over the filtering of the resulting send network traffic via web interface Openwrt-luci.
